    \item[1.3] What is the main difficulty that a programmer must overcome in writing
    an operating system for a real-time environment?
    \item[1.5] How does the distinction between kernel mode and user mode function
    as a rudimentary form of protection (security)?
    \item[1.6] Which of the following instructions should be privileged?
    \begin{enumerate}[a.]
        \item Set value of timer.
        \item Read the clock.
        \item Clear memory.
        \item Issue a trap instruction.
        \item Turn off interrupts.
        \item Modify entries in device-status table.
        \item Switch from user to kernel mode.
        \item Access I/O device.
    \end{enumerate} 
    \item[1.10] Give two reasons why caches are useful.What problems do they solve?
    What problems do they cause? If a cache can be made as large as the device for which it is caching (for instance, a cache as large as a disk),
    why not make it that large and eliminate the device?
    \item[1.11] Distinguish between the client–server and peer-to-peer models of distributed
    systems.
